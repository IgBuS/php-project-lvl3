Webpage analizer

This web application is for checking basic page parameters. They are response status, h1, title, and description. All you need is just enter the name of the website in the form on the main page (don't forget to check the format of the input, there is a hint for your convenience). After your URL has been stored, you may enter the URLâ€™s page and initiate a check. You will see the result soon. The number of checks is unlimited, please, feel free to tap the button as many times as you want.
In case there are some problems during the check, the application will show you what is the problem via a flash message.
